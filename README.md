## Description

A simple crud built with nestJS, mostly to learn how to use it, so I will be updating this till I feel good enough to start a new project using it.

## Installation

```bash
# clone it
# change name of .env.example to .env
$ docker compose up
# up and working on localhost:3000
```

## What can you do here?

For now, a simple CRUD of users to simulate user manipulation on a real app.

Users require a username, email, password and age.
Have fun testing!
